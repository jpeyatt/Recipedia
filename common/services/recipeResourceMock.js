After marinating, I broiled it the 5 mins time and it was very moist! However, I couldn't escape the albumin that formed on the side of the salmon. I basted the cooked salmon afterwards with some of the butter I melted down with the juice and then I also topped it off with a dollop of the remaining butter mixture that I had set side and didn't melt down.
